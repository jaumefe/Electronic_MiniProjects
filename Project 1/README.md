# Project 1: Preamplifier for a microphone
## Specifications
 * Build a preamplifier and a power stage to feed a loud speaker
 * The input signal is given by a electret microphone. The signal must be processed by a preamplifier stage and a power stage to feed a loudspeaker
 * The specifications to implement the preamplifier for a ECM microphone (capacitor microphone) are:
 	* Input Voltage: 12V
 	* Bandwidth: 10Hz - 20kHz
 	* Bandwidth gain: 20 dB
 	
## Components to be used:
 * Bipolar junction transistor and JFET
 * Resistors, potentiometres and condensateurs
 * Input Voltage: +/- 12V, +5V
 * Electret microphone CI EM100T
